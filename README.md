# Discord Mass DM Tool (Updated May 2025)

Welcome to the **Discord Mass DM Tool**! This powerful utility is designed for users who need to send discord mass dms or direct messages to multiple members in a Discord server efficiently. Unlike other tools, our solution is unique in its capability to solve captchas automatically, making it the only working mass DM tool on the market with this feature.

## Features

- **Member Scraping**: Automatically scrape the Discord server to gather a list of members for direct messaging.
- **Automated DM Sending**: Send discord dms or direct messages to multiple users simultaneously.
- **Blacklisting Admins**: This will automatically blacklist admins
- **Target Audience**: This will scrape the members from your target / rival / server of your niche which will give you your target audience and hence, your mass dm will be the most effective
- **Friend Dming**: Dm all friends on all of the tokens
- **All servers suppory**: Send messages in all channels in all servers
- **Proxy Support**: This supports proxies, which is essential when dming a lot of people and when solving captchas to not get flagged and lock the tokens.
- **Captcha Solving**: Integrated captcha solving capabilities ensure that your messages are delivered without interruptions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and easy-to-use commands make the tool accessible for everyone.
- **Open Source**: Review, modify, and contribute to the code as it is fully open-source.
