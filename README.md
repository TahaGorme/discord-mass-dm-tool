# Discord Mass DM Tool

Welcome to the **Discord Mass DM Tool**! This powerful utility is designed for users who need to send discord mass dms or direct messages to multiple members in a Discord server efficiently. Unlike other tools, our solution is unique in its capability to solve captchas automatically, making it the only working mass DM tool on the market with this feature.

## Features

- **Member Scraping**: Automatically scrape the Discord server to gather a list of members for direct messaging.
- **Automated DM Sending**: Send discord dms or direct messages to multiple users simultaneously.
- **Target Audience**: This will scrape the members from your target / rival / server of your niche which will give you your target audience and hence, your mass dm will be the most effective
- **Proxy Support**: This supports proxies, which is essential when dming a lot of people and when solving captchas to not get flagged and lock the tokens.
- **Captcha Solving**: Integrated captcha solving capabilities ensure that your messages are delivered without interruptions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and easy-to-use commands make the tool accessible for everyone.
- **Open Source**: Review, modify, and contribute to the code as it is fully open-source.

# Purchase Paid and Private Version
**Note**: This is a free version of my mass dm tool. This free version will **NOT** scrape the members. you will need manually put the user ids in the free version. This free version will **NOT** solve any captchas. The free version is not designed for mass dming on a larger scale. The tokens may get locked when using the free version as the free version does **NOT** have proxy support.
**To purchase the paid version that will automatically scrape and automatically solve captchas and mass dm on a larger scale without getting locked with proxy support, contact me on discord @uutu or on telegram @tahagorme**
